# The Project
> Developing a sentiment analysis model for financial social media posts

## The Problem
There is loads of research on sentiment analysis models for social media posts (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014; Barbierie et al., 2020) and on sentiment analysis of financial texts like news and corporate filings (Loughran & McDonald, 2011; Araci, 2019). However, the research on financial social media posts (think StockTwits, Reddit r/wallstreetbets, and Twitter) is limited.

## The Status-Quo
Researchers often utilize sentiment models from the adjacent domains of *finance* or *generic social media*. Therefore, be benchmark the most common models: VADER (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014), NTUSD-Fin (Chen et al., 2018), FinBERT (Araci, 2019), and TwitterRoBERTa (Barbierie et al., 2020)

## The Solution
We collect and label 10,000 tweets and train a varietiy of sentiment analysis models comparing their performance and compute footprints. The detailed methodology can be found [here](https://www.github.com/moritzwilksch/MasterThesisWriting). The final models will be open-sourced and availabe for anyone to use as [pyFin-sentiment](https://www.github.com/moritzwilksch/pyfin-sentiment): a python package for sentiment analysis of financial social media posts.

# Performance
## On Tweets
> Out-of-sample ROC AUC of proposed and existing models on the collected dataset of 10,000 tweets.

## On StockTwits Posts
> Out-of-sample ROC AUC of proposed and existing models on a dataset of StockTwits posts.  

Using the Fin-SoMe dataset compiled by Chen et al. (2020)

## Resourcefulness
Measured as inference time per sample (ms) on a system with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and 64GB of RAM

# `pyFin-Sentiment`
This work set out to publish a ***usable model artifact*** to provide future research with more accurate sentiment assessments. We therefore publish the proposed logistc regression model in an easy-to-use python library called [pyFin-Sentiment](https://github.com/moritzwilksch/pyfin-sentiment)
